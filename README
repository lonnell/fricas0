===================================
FriCAS0 -- a pure Common Lisp build
===================================

1. cd fricas0
2. load fricas.lisp into your favourite Lisp interpreter
3. First time (once): 
     )lisp (load "compile-algebra")
   Takes a few minutes.
4. )quit

Next time, when loading "fricas.lisp", it should work ;)

Notes
-----
i)   ABCL works, however, needs special treatment. See release,
     where you will find a fricas_abcl.zip.
ii)  Everything still is considered experimental (e.g. init, compile, save)
     Certain features are not yet implemented.
iii) Tested: SBCL, ECL, CLISP (Ubuntu/Cygwin64/MingW64/Windows 7&10)
     Newer versions of SBCL make troubles. Databases have to be rebuilt.
iv)  fricas0 is built with mkfricas0.sh from a source tarball after
     a regular build (see below).

----
Make
----
The bash script 'mkfricas0.sh' shows how it goes.
Running ./mkfricas0.sh creates the folder 'fricas0' and a package
'fricas0.tar.gz' as well from an official source tarball (pre-generated).

**IMPORTANT**
Edit the script to adjust the following first lines:

rename_cmd=rename.ul  # rename command (not the PERL one)
FRICAS0=fricas0       # name of the folder created
FRICAS_TREE=/home/xyz/devel/fricas-1.3.0  # Fricas tarball
FRICAS0_TMP=/home/xyz/devel/mkfricas0/$FRICAS0 # where to create it
